</head>
<body>
The default Radio app of Joying is in general working well (apart from the AF function which is completely wrong), but I don't like the layout.

I now made 5 versions: a BLUE_WHITE, a RED, a RED_WHITE, an ORANGE and a GREEN version. The RED and RED_WHITE version are simple modifications on the ones that XDA developer <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=70367793&postcount=434">gustden already made</a>.<br>
<i>Update 4 May 2017: Added the default stock Joying app in case you want to switch back.<br>
Update 17 April 2017: Added a green "Ford/Skoda" version.<br>
Update 7 April 2017: Added an orange "BMW" version; Corrected P2 button Red version.</i><br>

There are simply 5 folders each containing its own version with a simple install.bat and install.sh script for windows and linux likes.

The mods are currently:
<ul>
  <li>only the change of buttons (<a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=70367793&postcount=434">gustden's mods</a>),</li>
  <li>a change of lay-out, which is a json "text" file with xy-coordinates, and modifications of buttons. The buttons in my mods are half the size to create one row of buttons instead of two rows. (Other examples can be found <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=793304&st=1260#entry59675717">here</a> and <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=793304&st=1240#entry59642168">here</a>).</li>
</ul>

I put the PS text from (small) top left to the center, increased font size and removed the "PS: prefix, and put all station buttons on a single row.

The Radio app has a corrupted RDS text. The PS text is 8 characters and that same field is used for the 32 or 64 character RDS-text, but this string is not handled correctly by the app. 

The RED version is for older Audi (and older Volkswagen?)<br>
The RED_WHITE version is for a newer Audi (and newer Volkswagen ?)<br>
The BLUE_WHITE has the frequency in white instead of yellow.<br>
The ORANGE version is for BMWs.<br>
The GREEN versions is for Ford and Skoda.<br>
All have the modified Station name (PS text) and modified buttons.<br>
And for those who wantto switch back to the default Joying Radio app, I also added the JOYING_DEFAULT.


<strong>Requirements:</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li><code>adb</code> - For windows it has been packaged in this repository in the win-adb folder and it will be used from there. On Linux or one of the other systems you need to install it using your favorite package manager (like for Ubuntu/Debian likes: `sudo apt-get install adb`) or install it via the Android SDK (as can be done for windows as well).</li>
  <li>You need either a Windows Laptop/PC or a Linux/*BSD/MacOS X/Solaris laptop/PC that is connected to the same WiFi network as your Head Unit. You can find the ip-address of your head unit via <code>Settings -> WiFi; vertical "triple-dot" menu in top-right; Advanced</code>.</li>
</ul>

<strong>How-To install:</strong>
<ol>
<li>If you downloaded this repository as zip, you unzip the file somewhere to your disk.</li>
<li>
    <ul>
    <li>On Windows: Run CMD.exe as Administrator.</li> 
    <li>On Linux likes: Open a terminal.</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Change to the folder where you unzipped the files or downloaded the repository, and change into the `Radio_Mod` folder. Then change to the folder of your preferred color version.</li>
<li>
    <ul>
    <li>On Windows: Run the install.bat script with the IP address of your Head Unit as a parameter:  <code>install.bat 192.168.178.50</code> (for example)</li>
     <li>On linux: Run the install.sh script with the IP address of your Head Unit as a parameter: <code>./install.sh 192.168.178.50</code> (for example)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Wait until the script finishes.</li>
<li>Done. You can reboot but it is not neccessary.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Note!</strong>
If you get warnings that you don't get access to write/copy AND you have already rooted your device with SuperSu, you need to give access via the SuperSu apk to adb wanting to operate in root mode (the <code>su</code> command).<br><br>
