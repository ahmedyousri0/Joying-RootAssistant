    <ul>
        <li>ToDo:
            <ul>
                <li>Improve logging for better error detection.</li>
                <li>Build in "Sharing" option so you can easily share your temperature measurement files, log files to (g)mail, drive, dropbox, whatever.</li>
                <li>Expand network detection options. It now only looks for wifi. Will check as well for eth0.</li>
                <li>Add option to mount/unmount SD-cards.</li>
                <li>(Maybe) Add option to format SD-cards.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>22 July 2017, V 1.2
            <ul>
                <li>Note: SofiaServer binaries still based on 25 May version, but they should function also on 07 July ROM.</li>
                <li>Added Treel's multi-pairing BT app to replace Joyings crippled, limited apk (5.1.1 and 6.0.1 version)</li>
                <li>Corrected Settings.apk install. It did function but it installed too much.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /data. BE CAREFUL: Actually this is a "restore to factory defaults" option. It will therefore also remove this apk. I did no test this part.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /sdcard. BE Careful: This is internal memory storage. NOT one of your real sd-cards.</li>
                <li>Added a lot of logging options. Output is written to /sdcard/JET-YYYYMMDD.log. Every day a new log is created (only when you start the app), multiple uses on one day will add to the daily log. Note that this needs to be improvedin future versions.</li>
                <li>Check for new version upon startup with ability to download and install new version (Will of course start to work as of next release).</li>
                <li>Add version number as well to bottom line which already displayed Android version.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>06 July 2017, V 1.1
            <ul>
                <li>Add the Radio Mod of Sanangel (Credits: Sanangel)</li>
                <li>Add the Radio mod of Wilk7 (Credits: Wilk7)</li>
                <li>Add the Radio mod of Thodai (Credits: Thodai)</li>
                <li>Add option (link) in Radio Mods drop-downs to Online examples/previews page.</li>
                <li>Add another listpicker (drop-down) button "Other Mods" currently containing the Bluetooth, Music Player and Video Player from Wilk7. This one also includes an Online examples/previews page.</li>
                <!-- <li>Option to wipe your /data partition (with warning and twice "Are you sure?")</li> -->
                <li>Minor optimisations to underlying script.</li>
                <li>Clean up/Remove unnecessary assets.</li>
                <li>Correct shape of "Install Android .." from square to rounded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>01 July 2017, V 1.02
            <ul>
                <li>Add warning upon app startup in case of no WiFi (Can't test on 2G/3G/4G dongles).</li>
                <li>Add option to install either the full, standard Android Settings.apk, or the Joying Settings.apk</li>
                <li>Add "Hot Reboot" option to "Other Tools &amp; Tweaks" (hot reboot is a restart of Gui, apps and frameworks, instead of full reboot).</li>
                <li>Add reboot option to "Other Tools &amp; Tweaks" button.</li>
                <li>Integrate reboot option in feedback popup for the actions where a reboot is necesssary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>28 June 2017, V 1.01
            <ul><li>Try to improve robustness of Radio Mod install, especially on 6.0.1. (Stop Radio app, remove Dalvik cache for Radio, push modded Radio apk)</li>
                <li>Try to improve robustness of SofiaServer install, especially on 6.0.1. (remove Dalvik cache for SofiaServer, push modded SofiaServer apk)</li>
                <li>Add standard Joying SofiaServer apk to SofiaServer options (5.1.1 => 28 March version; 6.0.1 => 25 May version) in case the modded version does not work as expected.</li>
                <li>Alter DPI: 180 DPI option forgotten in 6.0.1 options.</li>
                <li>Make temperature monitoring file a real classic csv file: "value 1","value 2","value 3"</li>
            </ul>
