    <ul>
        <li>ToDo:
            <ul>
                <li>Build in "Sharing" option so you can easily share your temperature measurement files, log files to (g)mail, drive, dropbox, whatever.</li>
                <li>Expand network detection options. It now only looks for wifi. Will check as well for eth0.</li>
                <li>Add option to mount/unmount SD-cards.</li>
                <li>(Maybe) Add option to format SD-cards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>28 July 2017, V 1.4
            <ul>
                <li>Add a Android Settings.apk (and odex) for both the 25 May and the 07 July ROM. But it should not make a difference.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
        <li>23 July 2017, V 1.3
            <ul>
                <li>This is a slight modification of the 1.2 version.
There are some (big) differences between the 25 May 6.01 and older 6.0.1 versions, and the 07 July 6.0.1 version for a.o. the Joying BT apk, the Joying Settings.apk and the Joying SofiaServer apk.
This version still allows you to install the mods (for 25 May and older), but also allows you to reinstall the orginal versions for both 25 May and 07 July.
The original SofiaServer and Settings.apk are automatically reinstalled based on build date. You need to select the original BT app for the relevant ROM yourself.</li>
                <li>I wanted to release a 1.2.1 patch version, but my "check for updates" function crashes on sub numbers, e.g. 1.2.1. So I released a 1.3 version. To be improved in future versions.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
        <li>22 July 2017, V 1.2
            <ul>
                <li>Note: SofiaServer binaries still based on 25 May version, but they should function also on 07 July ROM.</li>
                <li>Added Treel's multi-pairing BT app to replace Joyings crippled, limited apk (5.1.1 and 6.0.1 version)</li>
                <li>Corrected Settings.apk install. It did function but it installed too much.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /data. BE CAREFUL: Actually this is a "restore to factory defaults" option. It will therefore also remove this apk. I did no test this part.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /sdcard. BE Careful: This is internal memory storage. NOT one of your real sd-cards.</li>
                <li>Added a lot of logging options. Output is written to /sdcard/JET-YYYYMMDD.log. Every day a new log is created (only when you start the app), multiple uses on one day will add to the daily log. Note that this needs to be improved in future versions.</li>
                <li>Check for new version upon startup with ability to download and install new version (Will of course start to work as of next release).</li>
                <li>Add version number as well to bottom line which already displayed Android version.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>06 July 2017, V 1.1
            <ul>
                <li>Add the Radio Mod of Sanangel (Credits: Sanangel)</li>
                <li>Add the Radio mod of Wilk7 (Credits: Wilk7)</li>
                <li>Add the Radio mod of Thodai (Credits: Thodai)</li>
                <li>Add option (link) in Radio Mods drop-downs to Online examples/previews page.</li>
                <li>Add another listpicker (drop-down) button "Other Mods" currently containing the Bluetooth, Music Player and Video Player from Wilk7. This one also includes an Online examples/previews page.</li>
                <!-- <li>Option to wipe your /data partition (with warning and twice "Are you sure?")</li> -->
                <li>Minor optimisations to underlying script.</li>
                <li>Clean up/Remove unnecessary assets.</li>
                <li>Correct shape of "Install Android .." from square to rounded.</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Add option to install either the full, standard Android Settings.apk, or the Joying Settings.apk</li>
                <li>Add "Hot Reboot" option to "Other Tools &amp; Tweaks" (hot reboot is a restart of Gui, apps and frameworks, instead of full reboot).</li>
                <li>Add reboot option to "Other Tools &amp; Tweaks" button.</li>
                <li>Integrate reboot option in feedback popup for the actions where a reboot is necesssary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>28 June 2017, V 1.01
            <ul><li>Try to improve robustness of Radio Mod install, especially on 6.0.1. (Stop Radio app, remove Dalvik cache for Radio, push modded Radio apk)</li>
                <li>Try to improve robustness of SofiaServer install, especially on 6.0.1. (remove Dalvik cache for SofiaServer, push modded SofiaServer apk)</li>
                <li>Add standard Joying SofiaServer apk to SofiaServer options (5.1.1 => 28 March version; 6.0.1 => 25 May version) in case the modded version does not work as expected.</li>
