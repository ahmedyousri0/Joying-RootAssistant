    <ul>
        <li>ToDo:
            <ul>
                <li>Add button "My Mods". This option can be used to install your own mods or distribute your mods in a zip to other users. Needs a local xml file (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/apk/mymods/my-jet-mods.xml" target="mymods">example</a>)</li>
                <li><strike>Build in "Sharing" option so you can easily share your temperature measurement files, log files to (g)mail, drive, dropbox, whatever.</strike> NOT: There are already 10 million apps that can do this.</li>
                <li>Expand network detection options. It now only looks for wifi. Will check as well for eth0.</li>
                <li>Add option to mount/unmount SD-cards.</li>
                <li>(Maybe) Add option to format SD-cards.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
 <!--       <li>xy August 2017, V 2.0
            <ul>
                <li>Added button with pull down menu "My Mods". This option can be used to install your own mods, or distribute your mods in a zip to other users. Needs a local xml file (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/apk/mymods/my-jet-mods.xml" target="mymods">example</a>)</li>
                <li>In the 1.4 and below options you could only switch on "adb over wifi" as service, meaning till the next reboot. As this should be a user decision and not my decision, I now added the "service" ON option (till next reboot) and the "persistent" ON option (constantly, through reboots)</li>
                <li>Internal: Full rewrite of menu sctructure. Was a big complex (messy) manual structure. Is now an autogenerated menu structure based on an internal xml file.</li>
                <li>Internal: Big partial rewrite of jetscript script based on menu structure change.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li> -->
        <li>03 August 2017, V 1.5
            <ul>
                <li>In the 1.4 and below options you could only switch on "adb over wifi" as service, meaning till the next reboot. In practice this works clumsy as you sometimes need to reboot multiple times. I switched to persistent now, meaning that it will stay ON through reboots. And if you don't need it: please switch it off.</li>
                <li>Added overscan parameter screen. It does need some "aesthetic improvements" but it functions. Note though that the screen of my app gets "distorted" when you apply new settings. No idea what that is.</li>
                <li>Add a 07 July "extended navi_app.txt only" SofiaServer, no further mods at all. (see file <a href="https://hvdwolf.github.io/Joying-RootAssistant/navi_app.txt" target="navi">here</a>)</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
        <li>23 July 2017, V 1.3
            <ul>
                <li>This is a slight modification of the 1.2 version.
There are some (big) differences between the 25 May 6.01 and older 6.0.1 versions, and the 07 July 6.0.1 version for a.o. the Joying BT apk, the Joying Settings.apk and the Joying SofiaServer apk.
This version still allows you to install the mods (for 25 May and older), but also allows you to reinstall the orginal versions for both 25 May and 07 July.
The original SofiaServer and Settings.apk are automatically reinstalled based on build date. You need to select the original BT app for the relevant ROM yourself.</li>
                <li>I wanted to release a 1.2.1 patch version, but my "check for updates" function crashes on sub numbers, e.g. 1.2.1. So I released a 1.3 version. To be improved in future versions.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
        <li>22 July 2017, V 1.2
            <ul>
                <li>Note: SofiaServer binaries still based on 25 May version, but they should function also on 07 July ROM.</li>
                <li>Added Treel's multi-pairing BT app to replace Joyings crippled, limited apk (5.1.1 and 6.0.1 version)</li>
                <li>Corrected Settings.apk install. It did function but it installed too much.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /data. BE CAREFUL: Actually this is a "restore to factory defaults" option. It will therefore also remove this apk. I did no test this part.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /sdcard. BE Careful: This is internal memory storage. NOT one of your real sd-cards.</li>
                <li>Added a lot of logging options. Output is written to /sdcard/JET-YYYYMMDD.log. Every day a new log is created (only when you start the app), multiple uses on one day will add to the daily log. Note that this needs to be improved in future versions.</li>
                <li>Check for new version upon startup with ability to download and install new version (Will of course start to work as of next release).</li>
                <li>Add version number as well to bottom line which already displayed Android version.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>06 July 2017, V 1.1
            <ul>
                <li>Add the Radio Mod of Sanangel (Credits: Sanangel)</li>
                <li>Add the Radio mod of Wilk7 (Credits: Wilk7)</li>
                <li>Add the Radio mod of Thodai (Credits: Thodai)</li>
                <li>Add option (link) in Radio Mods drop-downs to Online examples/previews page.</li>
                <li>Add another listpicker (drop-down) button "Other Mods" currently containing the Bluetooth, Music Player and Video Player from Wilk7. This one also includes an Online examples/previews page.</li>
                <!-- <li>Option to wipe your /data partition (with warning and twice "Are you sure?")</li> -->
                <li>Minor optimisations to underlying script.</li>
                <li>Clean up/Remove unnecessary assets.</li>
                <li>Correct shape of "Install Android .." from square to rounded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>01 July 2017, V 1.02
            <ul>
                <li>Add warning upon app startup in case of no WiFi (Can't test on 2G/3G/4G dongles).</li>
                <li>Add option to install either the full, standard Android Settings.apk, or the Joying Settings.apk</li>
                <li>Add "Hot Reboot" option to "Other Tools &amp; Tweaks" (hot reboot is a restart of Gui, apps and frameworks, instead of full reboot).</li>
                <li>Add reboot option to "Other Tools &amp; Tweaks" button.</li>
                <li>Integrate reboot option in feedback popup for the actions where a reboot is necesssary.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>28 June 2017, V 1.01
            <ul><li>Try to improve robustness of Radio Mod install, especially on 6.0.1. (Stop Radio app, remove Dalvik cache for Radio, push modded Radio apk)</li>
                <li>Try to improve robustness of SofiaServer install, especially on 6.0.1. (remove Dalvik cache for SofiaServer, push modded SofiaServer apk)</li>
                <li>Add standard Joying SofiaServer apk to SofiaServer options (5.1.1 => 28 March version; 6.0.1 => 25 May version) in case the modded version does not work as expected.</li>
