    <ul>
            <li>31 January 2018, V 37
            <ul>
                <li>Fix installation of own apk update and Xposed modules from my apk for the Joying Custom ROM. It turned out to be an increased security level coming from the Google package installer compared with the previous old package installer in the stock ROM.</li>
                <li>Added Mark Morto's Music player mod (credits: markmorto).</li>
                <li>Changes/enhancements SofiaServerCustomKeyMod Xposed module:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sofiaserver mutes the android channel 4 (alarm) output which is needed for Google Voice feedback. The SofiaServerCustomKyMod Xposed module now prevents that as well.</li>
                        <li>The BT/PTT steering wheel key (key 27) should now be supported.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>

         <li>26 January 2018, V 36
            <ul>
                <li>Bugfix: Corrected the "enable/disable adb over tcpip" again. The "adb over tcpip" check upon startup of the app was wrong. It always shows "Disabled" even after you just enabled it (which does function).</li>
                <li>Added the default Joying SofiaServer apks again for November and December but now with extended navi_app.txt and player_app.txt</li>
                <li>Added Mark Morto's Radio mod (credits: markmorto)</li>
                <li>Added first release of SofiaServerCustomKeyMod Xposed module (menu Tools/Tweaks/Xposed). The name will probably change in XSofiamod some time. This one still uses the laucher.sh script from Gustden (replace launcher.sh under SofiaServer menu).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Includes the NoKill module.</li>
                        <li>Does NOT support multi-press (double and triple tap)</li>
                        <li>Does not yet support the BT/PTT steering wheel key yet (key 27)</li>
                        <li>Media key supported, but with strange side effect: disables hardware keys for approx 1 minute, then mutes sound and unmutes sound (2-3 seconds), activates hardware keys again.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Added option to replace the default joying ringtone. This default ringtone is called fyt.ogg. Take your favorite ringtone, convert it to .ogg format and name it fyt.ogg. Copy it onto your internal memory (/sdcard). Then pick the option "Replace Ringtone" from the menu Tools/Tweaks/Xposed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
         <li>19 January 2018, V 35
            <ul>
                <li>Bugfix: Corrected the "enable/disable adb over tcpip". I had to rewrite everything after switching rooting method, but I made this also a rooted call which is not necessary and which does not work on a non-rooted unit which is what we start with.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
         <li>17 January 2018, V 34
             <p><strong>This version requires another rooting method if you want to use Xposed.</strong> See <a href="https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/releases/tag/20180107">here</a>. Note that Xposed is still experimental. There are happy users and users who got into boot loops needing to reflash their unit!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated the "enable/disable adb over tcpip". I had removed the reboot, as I restarted the adb services, but it still needs a reboot.</li>
                <li>Added Baloo1986 BT-dialer mod. This mod only takes the real bottom part of the screen when in a call. This means that your navigation app (or whatever app) remains visible. Credits: Baloo1986</li>
                <li>Added SofiaServer NoKill+CustomKeyMod for December. This is a direct mod, not an xposed module. Credits: DBestman</li>
            </ul>
             <p>Note: Mymods option still not working.</p>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
         <li>13 January 2018, V 33
             <p><strong>This version requires another rooting method if you want to use Xposed.</strong> See <a href="https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/releases/tag/20180107">here</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Added Xposed Framework and Installer to apk (NEEDS ANOTHER ROOTING METHOD!!)</li>
                <li>Added the GPSSpeedfix Xposed module (credits: lbdroid, carjoying)</li>
                <li>Added NoKill Xposed module. Thr xposed NoKill module can be used with any default Joying Sofiaserver version.</li>
                <li>Added the November NoKill SofiaServer mod (credits: realzoulou, XDA)</li>
                <li>Added the December NoKill SofiaServer mod (my mod)</li>
                <li>Added the new modded December Radio mod with RDS-txt and RDS-ps increased in size.</li>
                <li>Changed the "Enable/Disable adb over tcpip" option.</li>
                <li>Change version number to whole numbers and simply update. So going from 3.2 to 33 (like version code on Google Play).</li>
                <li>Re-enabled Viper4Android for 5.1.1</li>
                <li>Complete internal rewrite to make the apk compatible with Superuser.</li>
            </ul>
             <p>Note that you should use EITHER the Sofiaserver Nokill mod OR the Xposed Nokill module. At this moment the Nokill Sofiaserver mod might have the preference as it comes with an extend navigation app and music player list.</p>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
         <li>27 December 2017, V 3.2
            <ul>
                <li>Bugfix: typo in build date determination. (3.1 being the first untested build, immediately this issue. This is the 2nd untested, but hopefully correctly fixed build. I still don't have my unit back).</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
         <li>26 December 2017, V 3.1
            <ul>
                <li>Bugfix: Correct the install of the Settings.apk on the December version.</li>
                <li>Untested: Gustdens September Sofiaserver mods for December ROM. (I'm again without a head unit at the moment.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
         <li>17 December 2017, V 3.0
            <ul>
                <li>Added Joying and Android Settings.apk for November ROM (Credits: lbdroid)</li>
                <li>Due to lack of November SofiaServer mods, I added the September mods which seem to work fine.</li>
                <li>Added November default Radio app to restore to (<i>no new mods yet. The November Radio app has now functioning RDS-txt. I might make a new mod, but this doesn't require a new apk build</i>)</li>
                <li>Add forgotten 180 DPI setting in "Alter DPI" options</li>
                <!-- <li>Added Xposed Framework and installer.</li>
                <li>Added GPSSpeedfix xposed module (credits: lbdroid). Corrects the 3.6 km/h error in faulty Joying GPS HAL.</li> -->
                <li>Some further internal rework.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>15 November 2017, V 2.9
            <ul>
                <li>Due to material design the buttons on the "Monitor Temperatures and Frequencies" screen didn't fit anymore.</li>
                <li>After the rework (2.6 to 2.7) there was a typo in the BTTether.apk install, which therefore failed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>12 November 2017, V 2.8
            <ul>
                <li>Added L. Journets green (Skoda) Radio and Music player. (It came in minutes after the previous release)</li>
                <li>Again: Moved from Appinventor to Thunkable. They are identical but Appinventor supports Android >= 1.6 and Thunkable Android >= 4, thereby producing slightly more optimized code and supporting Material Design. <strong>This means that if you are still on 2.6 you have to uninstall the 2.6 version (first), otherwise you will have 2 apks</strong> (when opening the apk look at the bottom-right version).</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>11 November 2017, V 2.7
            <ul>
                <li>busybox update (1.26-2 to 1.27.1)</li>
                <li>Core Temperature and Frequency measurements (Tools & Tweaks): Reduced measurement frequency from 30 seconds to 10 seconds. This will give an approx. 140 Kb file in a 4 hour drive.</li>
                <li>Massive internal rewrite of the apk. Also resulted in changes for the jetscript doing the installs on the unit.</li>
                <li>Removed button "Rooting / Busybox / rsync" as the rooting part was not really useful inside the apk.</li>
                <li>Positioned the "Tools & Tweaks" button on the location of the removed button.</li>
                <li>Added "update busybox" and "Install rsync" under the "Tools & Tweaks" button.</li>
                <li>Removed "Install Viper4Android" entirely.</li>
                <li>Moved from Appinventor to Thunkable. They are identical but Appinventor supports Android >= 1.6 and Thunkable Android >= 4, thereby producing slightly more optimized code and supporting Material Design. <strong>This means that you have to uninstall the 2.6 version (first), otherwise you will have 2 apks</strong> (when opening the apk look at the bottom-right version).</li>
                <!-- <li>Added support for <a href="https://github.com/seSuperuser/Superuser">seSuperuser</a>. It is an open source su + Superuser apk.</li> -->
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>16 October 2017, V 2.6
            <ul>
                <li>Sign all apks where the signing was missing from the apk (apksigner verify "some.apk") => Blue-White radio; Wilk7 Radio mod; all 5.1.1 Radiomods; Treels BT mods; Wilk7 video and music mod (BT mod gives error and can't be signed).<br>This should prevent the occurrences that a mod has been installed and upon reboot "nothing" is there even though it was really installed.</li>
                <li>When pushing the SofiaServer custom keys mod to the unit, including the launcher.sh, the apk checks now whether a launcher.sh is already installed. If so, the launcher.sh will not be replaced.</li>
                <li>Added lbdroids <a href="https://github.com/lbdroid/JoyingIntelStuff">BluetoothTethering.apk</a>: Used to automatically establish a bluetooth data connection between the car radio and a data source like a cellular phone. Install this on BOTH devices. ("Under button  Other mods")</li>
                <li>Added lbdroids <a href="https://github.com/lbdroid/FFMpeg-DashCam">Dashcam.apk</a>: "Non-crappy Dashcam for CRAPPY Chinese car radios".</li>
                <li>In V2.4 I switched to always installing the latest Android AOSP Settings.apk (when chosen). It now turns out that stupid Joying (FYT) also built in dependencies in that one making it firmware version dependent. So now a Android "AOSP" Settings.apk will be installed for the relevant Joying firmware version it is running on.</li>
                <!-- <li>Added support for <a href="https://github.com/seSuperuser/Superuser">seSuperuser</a>. It is an open source su + Superuser apk.</li> -->
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>05 October 2017, V 2.5
            <ul>
                <li>Add gustdens 01 September SofiaServer mods (Only SofiaServer mods of 25 May and newer are supported in my apk)</li>
            </ul>
            <p> </p>
       </li>
       <li>30 September 2017, V 2.4
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed annoying useless white popup (forgotten test option) in the "Monitor core temperatures and frequencies" screen (Tools & Tweaks button)</li>
                <li>Add SofiaServer No-Kill Steering wheel mod for 07 July ROM (credits: DBestman). The 07 July version as such supports both the old as new internal amp Joyings.</li>
                <li>Add latest 01 September versions of SofiaServer (for recovery), Google Settings.apk and Joying Settings.apk (for recovery)</li>
                <li>Internal: Simplify script and apk somewhat more (way too many if-then-else and case statements)</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
        <li>04 September 2017, V 2.3
            <ul>
                <li>Bugfix: The "My Mods" option loops through the xml file. With only one entry in the file that did not work.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
       <li>03 September 2017, V 2.2
            <ul>
                <li>Improved the "My Mod" option. For type "other" mods it checks the apk name. If it is equal to one of the AllApp.pkg apks, we know the package name which means we can kill the app and remove the odex. This always forces a re-compilation upon reboot.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
       <li>25 August 2017, V 2.1
            <ul>
                <li>Made a stupid error in the "enable/disable over WiFi" function. It used root permissions. This is not necessary at all and the permissions are of course not available before rooting. It doesn't matter after rooting of course.(Was carried over from one of the previous versions).</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>24 August 2017, V 2.0
            <ul>
                <li>Added button with pull down menu "My Mods". This option can be used to install your own mods, or distribute your mods other users. It needs a local xml file (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/apk/mymods/mymods.xml" target="mymods">example</a>).<br>See an explanation of the functionality on the <a href="https://hvdwolf.github.io/Joying-RootAssistant/mymods.html" target="top">My Mods</a> page.</li>
                <li>Added a splash screen.</li>
                <li>Added another "Sharing" option (top-left menu) so you can easily share your temperature & CPU freq measurement csv files to GDrive/dropbox/mail/whatever.</li>
                <li>Added Krzycho26's "space" radio mod and his "jeans" Bluetooth mod (credits to Krzycho26).</li>
                <li>Added a "Remove all application logs and csv files" option (top-left menu).</li>
                <li>Internal: Some rewriting of functions.</li>
                <li>Internal: Partial rewrite of menu sctructure. Was a big complex (messy) manual structure. Is now partially an autogenerated menu structure.</li>
                <li>Internal: Partial rewrite of jetscript script, also a major cleanup of messy code.</li>
                <li>Added a "donate to me" option in the top-left menu (Feel free to ignore :) ). I also added it to the index of the website.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
         </li>
         <li>11 August 2017, V 1.6
            <ul>
                <li>I use the rom build date in the ROMS as marker for installing certain apks (For example: the 07 July release has a zip date of 5 July, but a build date (ro.builddate) of 29 June 2017). Joying publishes their releases via their <a href="https://www.carjoying.com/blog/joying-head-unit-after-sale-support/59.html">Blog</a>. However, it turns out though that they also publish "intermediate" builds when sending their units to customers. We already detected a 15 June 2017 ROM as well. That requires extra "if-then-else" statements to check on these build dates.</li>
                <li>Expanded the Temperature measurements screen. It now meausures temperature and CPU frequencies. And it can still save this every 30 seconds to file. As a direct read of CPU frequencies the way I do it also requires root access, the option has now been removed from the top-left menu and placed behind the "Tools and Tweaks" button.</li>
                <li>Builtin "Sharing" option (top-left menu) so you can easily share your logs (to be further expanded).</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>03 August 2017, V 1.5
            <ul>
                <li>In the 1.4 and below options you could only switch on "adb over wifi" as service, meaning till the next reboot. In practice this works clumsy as you sometimes need to reboot multiple times. I switched to persistent now, meaning that it will stay ON through reboots. And if you don't need it: please switch it off.</li>
                <li>Added overscan parameter screen. It does need some "aesthetic improvements" but it functions. Note though that the screen of my app gets "distorted" when you apply new settings. No idea what that is.</li>
                <li>Add a 07 July "extended navi_app.txt only" SofiaServer, no further mods at all. (see file <a href="https://hvdwolf.github.io/Joying-RootAssistant/navi_app.txt" target="navi">here</a>)</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>23 July 2017, V 1.3
            <ul>
                <li>This is a slight modification of the 1.2 version.
There are some (big) differences between the 25 May 6.01 and older 6.0.1 versions, and the 07 July 6.0.1 version for a.o. the Joying BT apk, the Joying Settings.apk and the Joying SofiaServer apk.
This version still allows you to install the mods (for 25 May and older), but also allows you to reinstall the orginal versions for both 25 May and 07 July.
The original SofiaServer and Settings.apk are automatically reinstalled based on build date. You need to select the original BT app for the relevant ROM yourself.</li>
                <li>I wanted to release a 1.2.1 patch version, but my "check for updates" function crashes on sub numbers, e.g. 1.2.1. So I released a 1.3 version. To be improved in future versions.</li>
            </ul>
             <p> </p>
       </li>
        <li>22 July 2017, V 1.2
            <ul>
                <li>Note: SofiaServer binaries still based on 25 May version, but they should function also on 07 July ROM.</li>
                <li>Added Treel's multi-pairing BT app to replace Joyings crippled, limited apk (5.1.1 and 6.0.1 version)</li>
                <li>Corrected Settings.apk install. It did function but it installed too much.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /data. BE CAREFUL: Actually this is a "restore to factory defaults" option. It will therefore also remove this apk. I did no test this part.</li>
                <li>Added option to wipe /sdcard. BE Careful: This is internal memory storage. NOT one of your real sd-cards.</li>
                <li>Added a lot of logging options. Output is written to /sdcard/JET-YYYYMMDD.log. Every day a new log is created (only when you start the app), multiple uses on one day will add to the daily log. Note that this needs to be improved in future versions.</li>
                <li>Check for new version upon startup with ability to download and install new version (Will of course start to work as of next release).</li>
                <li>Add version number as well to bottom line which already displayed Android version.</li>
