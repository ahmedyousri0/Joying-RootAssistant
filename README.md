# Joying-RootAssistant

WARNING: Only for joying Intel 3GR head units.

Currently this repository only contains the SuperSU install scripts, the busybox upgrade scripts and 3 modded versions of the radio app. 

## SuperSU_for_Joying_Intel
The Joying units are rooted but miss a user-friendly Superuser apk that deals with the SELinux policies on your unit.
Download the relevant zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/releases/) page.


## Radio Mods
Note: now split in a 5.1.1 and a 6.0.1 section.
The standard layout of the Joying radio app is not very nice. These mods contain one version of a changed layout in 5 colors for 5.1.1 and a new one for 6.0.1.<br>
  * Click the [Radio-Mod](https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/tree/master/Radio-Mod) link here or in above list to read the Readme on that page for instructions.
  * Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/releases/tag/20170617) page to download the relevant zip. 

-----
This repo should grow in time to contain sets of scripts and an apk to simplify adding/removing/modifying apks on your Joying unit.
