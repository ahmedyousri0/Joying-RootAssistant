# Joying-RootAssistant

WARNING: Only for joying Intel 3GR head units.

Currently this repository only contains the SuperSU install scripts, the busybox upgrade scripts and 3 modded versions of the radio app. 

## SuperSU_for_Joying_Intel
The Joying units are rooted but miss a user-friendly Superuser apk that deals with the SELinux policies on your unit.
These scripts can be found in the SuperSU_for_Joying_Intel folder.<br>
Note: Click the [SuperSU_for_Joying_Intel](https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/tree/master/SuperSU_for_Joying_Intel) link here or in the list above to read the Readme on that page for instructions.
Note: Use the top-right green button "Clone or download", and download the zip.
Unzip this zip file somewhere on your pc/laptop.


## busybox-X86
The busybox version on the Joying head units is relatively old and buggy. The scripts in the busybox-X86 folder will update the busybox version on your system.<br>
Note: Click the [busybox-X86](https://github.com/hvdwolf/Joying-RootAssistant/tree/master/busybox-X86) link here or in the list above to read the Readme on that page for instructions.

## Radio Mods
Note: now split in a 5.1.1 and a 6.0.1 section.
The standard layout of the Joying radio app is not very nice. These mods contain one version of a changed layout in 5 colors for 5.1.1 and a new one for 6.0.1.<br>

-----
This repo should grow in time to contain sets of scripts and an apk to simplify adding/removing/modifying apks on your Joying unit.
